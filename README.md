Project Overview

This project demonstrates JUnit 5 Test Automation for a simple Java-based Calculator.

It covers unit testing of core arithmetic operations — add, subtract, multiply, and divide — implemented using Eclipse IDE and Apache Maven.

Each test case is designed following Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP) and Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) strategies to ensure full functional coverage and validation of edge cases.
